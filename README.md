## Introduction

The mining industry plays a crucial role in various economies, making miner safety a paramount concern. This project aims to develop a robot capable of navigating the mine environment autonomously. By integrating sensors such as gas sensors, temperature sensors, light sensors, and more, the robot gathers essential data to ensure the safety of miners and enhance mine surveillance.

## Literature Survey

Previous studies have explored similar concepts, such as unmanned vehicles for coal mines, city-searching robots for disaster scenarios, and more. This project builds upon these ideas to create a comprehensive scouting robot capable of detecting multiple hazards simultaneously.

## Problem Statement

Accidents and fatalities in mines are a significant concern. This project addresses the need for a safer mining environment by creating a real-time robot that can detect and analyze potential hazards. The robot's capabilities include gas detection, temperature monitoring, light intensity assessment, and terrain tilt detection.

## Proposed Methodology

The proposed methodology involves integrating various sensors into the robot's design:

- Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects obstacles and helps the robot avoid collisions.
- Gas Sensor: Monitors gas concentration and alerts for high levels.
- Light Sensor (LDR): Adjusts light intensity based on the environment's brightness.
- Temperature Sensor: Detects temperature variations and warns of potential fire hazards.
- Tilt Sensor: Alerts to uneven terrain and potential slope issues.

The robot's actions are programmed using Arduino, allowing it to navigate autonomously while gathering crucial data.

## Results and Discussion

The project's implementation yielded several strengths and weaknesses:

Strengths:
- Real-time hazard detection using multiple sensors.
- Autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- Warning messages for potential hazards.
- Data transmission to ThingSpeak for analysis.

Weaknesses:
- Autonomous movement limitations in complex mine structures.
- Lack of internal mine environment visualization.
- Connectivity issues for data transmission.

The project's results were visualized using MATLAB to provide an overall understanding of the mine environment.

## Conclusion

The mine scouting robot project demonstrates the potential of integrating sensors into autonomous robots to improve miner safety. By collecting data on gas concentration, temperature, light, and terrain conditions, the robot contributes to reducing the risks associated with mining activities.
